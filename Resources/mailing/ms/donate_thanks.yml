    Hi %USERNAME%,


    Thanks for your donation of **%DONATE_AMOUNT%** to the Goteo Foundation, we have received it! *Drop by drop, together we are an ocean :)* Which helps us to work even more energetically supporting initiatives with social impact. 


    Remember that, thanks to your donation and your support to the Goteo Foundation, a [certificate](%CERTIFICATE_URL%) is available for your tax deduction (if you are a fiscal resident in Spain).


    A warm hug!


    The Goteo team
